# Work Examples
Examples of work in Python, R and Tableau

[Web scraping; Python](https://github.com/jdsandow/examples/blob/main/IMDb-scraping-Python)

[A map of Pact members; Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jd8131/viz/Pact/Sheet1)

[Appending Excel spreadsheets; R](https://github.com/jdsandow/examples/blob/main/append-Excel-files-in-R)

[Listing folder details; R](https://github.com/jdsandow/examples/blob/main/subfolder-details-in-R)

[Fuzzy matching and merging data tables; R](https://github.com/jdsandow/examples/blob/main/matching-titles-in-r)  
This is a guide for a work colleague who has limited experience in R, guiding them step-by-step through data cleaning and using stringdist to join tables based on the Longest Common Substring

[Comparing film ranking on IMDb between men and women; Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jd8131/viz/IMDbGenderSplit/Summary2)  
This was a project I gave myself to simulatenously learn Python and Tableau. It is a very rough work-in-progress that I have since decided to scrap and redo (see top example for the beginning of this). This shows you the relative ranking of films by all voters, women only and men only, that you can then filter and the ranks recalculate based on genre(s) or years.
